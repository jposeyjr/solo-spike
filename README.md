# Vatti Pacman

## \_Duration

8 hours including learning three.js / react-three-fiber

## Description

This game was made as a spike to learn to add graphics to my react capstone project I have coming up. I learned a lot about graphics in Javascript and the three.js engine. But I ultimately found when it comes to adding three.js to React it is simply not worth it. You can add it with a great wrapper called react-three-fiber BUT you have to do so much additional work to get multiple pages to work. At the end of the day I know, my application will not need anything outside of basic images. As the saying goes "just because you can do something doesn't mean you should".
